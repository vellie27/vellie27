Hi there 👋

I'm a data engineer with a passion for building robust and scalable data pipelines. My projects focus on using Python to extract, transform, and load data from various sources, making it ready for analysis and insights.

⚙️ My Skills & Technologies

• Languages: Python

• Data Engineering: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), Data Orchestration

• Tools & Frameworks: Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka

• Databases: SQL,MongoDB

• Concepts: Real-time data processing, Data Warehousing, API Integration

🚀 Pinned Top Projects

-earthquake_cdc_pipeline

An end-to-end data pipeline for collecting and processing real-time earthquake data. This project demonstrates a Change Data Capture (CDC) approach to ensure data freshness and integrity.

-crypto_data_pipeline

A pipeline designed to pull live cryptocurrency data from an API, process it, and store it in a structured format. This project showcases skills in API integration and data transformation.

-weather_dag

A project using Apache Airflow to orchestrate the collection and processing of weather data from an external source. It highlights the use of DAGs for managing complex data workflows.

🌱 Goals for the Future

I'm currently focused on expanding my expertise in real-time data streaming and exploring advanced data modeling techniques. I'm also looking to learn more about cloud data platforms like AWS or Google Cloud to deploy and scale my pipelines.
